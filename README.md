# Threejs-Grid
Threejs class for creating a dynamic grid around your objects for engineering domain. The grid changes so as to make the object unobscured always.

As a user, the most important file is **SwappingGrid.js**. **CommonUtilities.js** contains some of the utility functions. So these two when included in your project, you can be able to create the grid.
**Main.js** shows how you can initiate the grid. It also has other things like setting up a scene, camera, Dat-GUI simple UI to switch between Orthographic and Perspective camera, change opacity of object or options to manipulate grid behaviour.

This whole repo is a demo how you can use the grid. If you replace the Main Object, (Object surrounded with the grid) you will be able to have the grid for your project.

The grid divisions can be converted into any suitable unit, you will have to look for the place in SwappingGrid.js to add the Units as you want.
